              I have had no experience in volunteering but i
              love giving back to the society in the little ways i can.
              I want to be a part of this movement because it is another way of
              giving back. The thought of children hawking really hurts me and nothing
              will give me greater pleasure than relieving them of the weights on their heads.

                  practical knowledge and sound mentorship to rebuild their lives,

              I have had experience in vounteering with UNICEF and I currently volunteer with
              Royal Mifadelo I love charity and humanity work. I love to help people who
              I'm in a position to, and sometimes, go out of my way too. It gives me joy
              seeing I'm able to put a smile on people's face. Above all, it pleases God
              when we show love to others through our actions.

              I enjoy volunteering and making myself available to contribute my
              part to causes I'm passionate about, especially when I'm capable
              of being part of the change. I am a member of The Ganglion Initiative,
              Junior Chambers International Nigeria, Slum and Rural Health Initiative
              Network and I really enjoy volunteering.
              Child Hawking poses as a threat to one of the fundamental human rights.
              It's not and should not be a means to end. I'm a part of this movement
              because I seek to be an advocate to parents, guardians, teachers and
              even young children about the injustice child hawking is. I wish to also
              educate them and be an eye-opener
