              I have had no experience in volunteering but i
              love giving back to the society in the little ways i can.
              I want to be a part of this movement because it is another way of
              giving back. The thought of children hawking really hurts me and nothing
              will give me greater pleasure than relieving them of the weights on their heads.

              <p>I have been an advocate for the advancement of lives and
                  territories for over two decades. What drew me into it was
                  because it mirrors my own divine purpose of uplifting
                  and Transforming the Child and teenager mindset through
                  practical knowledge and sound mentorship to rebuild their lives,
                  homes and nation in view.

              I have had experience in vounteering with UNICEF and I currently volunteer with
              Royal Mifadelo I love charity and humanity work. I love to help people who
              I'm in a position to, and sometimes, go out of my way too. It gives me joy
              seeing I'm able to put a smile on people's face. Above all, it pleases God
              when we show love to others through our actions.

              <p>Helping in the little way I can has alway been one of my life's goal. I feel everyone
                deserve a chance to be something more, so I saw this movement as an avenue to
                give back to the society and show love in the little way I can.
